# Understanding the Dynamics of Consumer Price Index (CPI) of Bangladesh
<h2> Summary of the Report: </h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This report examines the dynamics of Consumer Price Index in the context of the economy of Bangladesh. Firstly, to predict and understand the impact of Bangladesh’s top 5 trade partners on the consumer price index of Bangladesh a regression model has been developed. It was found that among the top 5 trade partners China’s and Germany’s CPI change has strongest correlation with Bangladesh’s CPI. Correlation has been used to comprehend the importance of other macroeconomic factors on consumer price index. Here, remittance was found to have strongest correlation with Bangladesh’s CPI. Finally, the CPI of Bangladesh has been compared with other developing countries using ANOVA testing. . It was found that CPI of Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh did not have statistically significant differences among each other.
<h3>Policy Implication from Findings Using Statistical Instruments </h3>
Based on the findings and analysis of this report, the following policy implications are relevant:
<br>
<br>
<ol type = "a">
  <li>Statistical significance indicates that trends in CPI of Bangladesh can be predicted based on the CPI of its top 5 trade partners (which are China, Germany, India, United Kingdom, and United States). So short term predictions of CPI and corresponding policy decisions related to the predictions of CPI can be based on (or further authenticated using) CPI data of the trade partners.</li>
  <li>Empirical observations suggest that the impact of real interest rates or exchange rates on CPI is not very significant. However, the correlation between CPI and remittance is extremely high. So major trends and predictions regarding remittance should be a point of discussion in making decisions or policies related to CPI.</li>
  <li>There is no statistically significant difference among the CPI of the developing countries taken into consideration. This indicates we are on par in this regard. However, close monitoring of the CPI of these countries and comparison with ours may indicate shortcomings or advantages in case of future deviations.</li>
